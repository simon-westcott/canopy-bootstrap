To rebrand this template for a customer you will need to edit the canopycss.less file.

The sections for rebranding are commented in the .less file, there should be no need to edit anything but the '@' classes at the beginning.

Once any edits have been completed, compile the less file into css. This allows your website to load quicker and makes it more secure.
WINDOWS: 
	Download winless from winless.org.
	Click 'Add folder', your less file should be shown on the right hand side.
	Ensure that your less file is checked.
	The 'Minify' checkbox is optional.
	Click 'Compile', this may take a couple of minutes.
	The output css file, by default, will be called the same as the input less file and will be in the same folder.


'@' classes can be nested, as shown in the original Canopycss.less file. Any nested '@' can be changed for direct css.
An example from the original file:

	Here our table text will render as the same colour as the main text: #0066a2 (blue)

	@main-text: #0066a2;
	@table-text: @main-text;

	However, I may want our table text to be a shade of red:

	@table-text: #CC0000;

	This has now removed the connection between table text and the main text; making our table text red whilst keeping the main text blue.


Nesting classes can make changing a color much quicker.

	The example below shows several classes all with the same values:

	@inverse-text: #FFFFFF;
	@navbar-bg: #FFFFFF;
	@navbar-border: #ffffff #ffffff #0066a2 #ffffff;
	@footer-bg: #FFFFFF;

	Further edits can be made easier my nesting these classes to make this:

	@inverse-text: #FFFFFF;
	@navbar-bg: @inverse-text;
	@navbar-border: @inverse-text @inverse-text #0066a2 @inverse-text;
	@footer-bg: @inverse-text;

	This renders the navbar background, 3 sides of its border and the footer background the same color as the inverse text; changing the inverse-text color, changes all of these as well.


There are 2 custom classes: .footer and .footer-text that are not from bootstrap; these are still customizable, the same as the bootstrapped css.
