This project is to create a branded bootstrap theme for Canopy products, with the requirement to be easily customizable for a customer.

The lessout-v2.css file changes twitter bootstrap to match the Canopy theme and should be used in addition to the normal twitter bootstrap files.

example html.html shows the customized elements in this template including the header, footer, buttons and tables.
login.html shows a simple fully html canopy branded login page.

To customize this for your site, follow the instrcutions on Rebranding.txt. The initial.css file should not be linked to in any html.
